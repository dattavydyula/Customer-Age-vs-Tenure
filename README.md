# Customer-Age-vs-Tenure
Users can see how long customers have been with the bank, broken into four tenure buckets.  They can view debit transaction intensity in grouped ranges.  They can analyze total spending patterns across tenure.  They can drill down into specific age ranges using radio buttons.  They can filter everything by bank number, age group, and balance range.
